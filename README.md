This is the company website of Armat Ofset & Ambalaj. I aimed to keep the design simple and information based since the customer base of this firm is mid to old-aged people. 
There is a Whatsapp button to contact the firm. When pressed, it opens the app with the spesific phone number and the customer can chat right away.
In the footer, (for mobile users) there is a google maps widget. When clicked it redirects to google maps page of the company. And if wanted, customers can set route to the office.

This is not the final version of this website. I intend to add references of the company and maybe some photos of the machines that the company use. In the future i might be able to design an order system too but this is the topic for another video.
